The trees, standing like silent sentinels, leaned in towards the narrow trail, their skeletal branches interlocking to form a natural barrier. Shadows danced between the trunks, playing tricks on my imagination. As I moved deeper, the path began to twist and turn unpredictably, and the skeletal fingers of branches reached out as if to grab hold of any who dared to intrude upon their realm. Suddenly I hear a swift approach from behind as a loud thump collapses me to the ground. A sharp pain in the back of my skull, the taste of dirt as consciousness fades.",

As your eyes begin to adjust to the dark room you stand up and realize you are in some kind of dungeon with cages and shackles along the opposite wall. There is a wooden table in front of you and is a couple feet away from you. You look to your right to see a chest that has a lock on it. You look to your left to see a door that could be an exit.",
