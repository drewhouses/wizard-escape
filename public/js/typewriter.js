The trees, standing like silent sentinels, leaned in towards the narrow trail, their skeletal branches interlocking to form a natural barrier. Shadows danced between the trunks, playing tricks on my imagination. As you move deeper, the path began to twist and turn unpredictably, and the skeletal fingers of branches reached out as if to grab hold of any who dared to intrude upon their realm. Suddenly, you hear a swift approach from behind as a loud thump collapses you to the ground. A sharp pain in the back of your skull, the taste of dirt as consciousness fades.",
